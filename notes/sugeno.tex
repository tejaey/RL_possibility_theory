\section{Introduction}

The Sugeno integral is a nonlinear aggregation operator widely used in fuzzy measure theory, decision making, and fuzzy control systems. Unlike the classical Lebesgue or Choquet integrals, which are linear or quasi-linear, the Sugeno integral is based on the use of \emph{min} and \emph{max} operations. It is particularly well-suited for situations where information is qualitative or ordinal rather than strictly quantitative.

\section{Definition of the Sugeno Integral}

Let \(X\) be a nonempty set and let \(f: X \to \) be a function (often interpreted as a fuzzy function or a utility function) defined on \(X\). Let \(\mu: 2^X \to [0,1]\) be a fuzzy measure (also called a capacity) defined on the power set of \(X\). The fuzzy measure \(\mu\) is assumed to be monotonic, i.e., for all \(A, B \subseteq X\),
\[
A \subseteq B \implies \mu(A) \leq \mu(B),
\]
and normalized such that
\[
\mu(\emptyset) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \mu(X) = 1.
\]

The \textbf{Sugeno integral} of \(f\) with respect to \(\mu\) is defined as:
\[
\int_X f \,d\mu = \sup_{t \in [0,1]} \min\Bigl\{t,\, \mu\bigl(\{ x \in X \mid f(x) \geq t \}\bigr)\Bigr\}.
\]
In this definition:
\begin{itemize}
  \item For each threshold \(t \in [0,1]\), the set
  \[
  A_t = \{ x \in X \mid f(x) \geq t \}
  \]
  is called the \emph{level set} of \(f\).
  \item The value \(\mu(A_t)\) represents the measure (or weight) of the set of inputs at which \(f\) attains at least the value \(t\).
  \item The operation \(\min\{t,\, \mu(A_t)\}\) can be interpreted as the joint satisfaction of the level \(t\) and the plausibility of that level as provided by \(\mu\).
  \item Finally, taking the supremum over \(t\) selects the highest value for which both the level and its plausibility are jointly maximized.
\end{itemize}

\section{Properties of the Sugeno Integral}

The Sugeno integral has several important properties that differentiate it from linear integrals:

\subsection{Monotonicity}
If \(f\) and \(g\) are functions such that \(f(x) \leq g(x)\) for all \(x \in X\), then
\[
\int_X f \,d\mu \leq \int_X g \,d\mu.
\]
This property follows directly from the monotonicity of both \(f\) and the fuzzy measure \(\mu\).

\subsection{Idempotence}
If \(f(x) = c\) is a constant function for all \(x \in X\), then
\[
\int_X f \,d\mu = c.
\]
This holds because for every \(t \leq c\), the level set \(A_t = X\) (thus \(\mu(X) = 1\)) and for every \(t > c\), \(A_t = \emptyset\) (thus \(\mu(\emptyset) = 0\)). The supremum of \(\min\{t,1\}\) as \(t\) varies in \([0, c]\) is exactly \(c\).

\subsection{Comonotonic Additivity (Nonlinearity)}
Unlike the Lebesgue or Choquet integrals, the Sugeno integral is not additive in general. However, if two functions \(f\) and \(g\) are \emph{comonotonic} (i.e., they do not cross each other and their values preserve the same order), certain additive-like properties can hold. In general, the Sugeno integral is a \emph{nonlinear} operator, reflecting its suitability for qualitative and ordinal aggregation.

\section{Interpretation and Applications}

The Sugeno integral is particularly useful when the available information is imprecise or when one is dealing with linguistic or ordinal data. For instance, in decision-making under uncertainty, a decision-maker might not have precise probabilities but rather a qualitative assessment of different outcomes. The Sugeno integral can then aggregate these qualitative evaluations by considering the worst-case (via the \(\min\) operator) and best-case (via the \(\sup\)) scenarios simultaneously.

In the context of reinforcement learning, the Sugeno integral can be used to aggregate uncertain or imprecise estimates of rewards or state-values. For example, when an RL agent has multiple estimates of a Q-value, each accompanied by a possibility distribution, the Sugeno integral can combine these to yield an overall assessment that respects both the optimistic and pessimistic evaluations of the state.
