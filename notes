1. Estimating epsitemic uncertainity for each state and increase the randomness based on that 

Not sure how to do that 

idea being that we have more epsitemic uncertainity for some states and we should be more random on those 

Previous techniques - ensemble models to estimate uncertainity

2. Using Fuzzy possiblity functions 

Instead of a single value for Q using Q_star which has a guassian possiblity distribution 
Target is also a gaussian possiblity 
use Divergence between two distributions as loss 

we could something like a triangle possiblity function as well 

select the action with highest mean + some sigma 

3. Gaussian Processes ???
