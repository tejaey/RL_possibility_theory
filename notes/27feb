Introduction

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is fundamentally concerned with decision-making under uncertainty. While probability theory is the conventional tool for modeling uncertainty in RL, possibility theory offers an alternative framework that provides a different perspective on uncertainty, especially epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty due to lack of knowledge). This introduction presents an overview of possibility theory, its mathematical foundations, and how it contrasts with probability theory. We then discuss the algebraic structures underlying possibility theory (such as suprema and t-norms) in comparison to probabilistic operations. Following that, we explore the relevance of possibility theory to RL, including its connections to epistemic uncertainty, implications for exploration, and uses in fuzzy reinforcement learning. We further examine how possibility theory can be applied to modern RL techniques like Deep Q-Learning and ensemble Q-networks to enhance decision-making. Finally, we outline additional research directions, highlighting extensions beyond current quantile-based models and other promising, underexplored avenues at the intersection of possibility theory and RL. Throughout, our aim is to frame these concepts clearly and accessibly for an undergraduate thesis, emphasizing key ideas and their significance.
Overview of Possibility Theory
Foundations and Concepts: Possibility theory is a mathematical theory of uncertainty introduced by Lotfi Zadeh in 1978 as an extension of his work on fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. In this framework, uncertainty is quantified by possibility and necessity measures, which assess how plausible or how certain an event is, respectively, given available knowledge. Both measures range from 0 to 1, where 0 means “impossible” (or “completely uncertain”) and 1 means “fully possible” or “totally necessary”​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. Didier Dubois and Henri Prade further developed the theory in the 1980s, providing a rigorous foundation and axioms for these measures​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. Unlike probability (which is typically interpreted as frequency of occurrence or a betting rate for an event), a possibility value expresses the degree to which an event could be true given what is known​
KUSCHOLARWORKS.KU.EDU
. For example, saying an event has possibility 0.8 does not mean it happens 80% of the time; rather, it means the event is fairly plausible (not ruled out by current knowledge), whereas a probability of 0.8 would imply a strong statistical likelihood​
KUSCHOLARWORKS.KU.EDU
.Mathematical Structure: Formally, possibility theory assigns a possibility distribution π over the state space (or outcomes). This distribution is analogous to a probability distribution but follows different normalization: it requires that at least one state has π value 1 (the maximum possible), ensuring there is at least one “fully possible” outcome​
ARXIV.ORG
. The induced possibility measure Π for any event (subset of states) is defined as the supremum (maximal value) of π on that event​
ARXIV.ORG
. In other words:
Possibility measure: Π(A) = sup{ π(x) : x ∈ A }​
ARXIV.ORG
.
This yields the axioms of possibility theory, which contrast with those of probability theory. Notably, for any two disjoint events U and V, the possibility measure satisfies:
Π(U ∪ V) = max(Π(U), Π(V))​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
.
This is in place of the additive law of probability which would use a sum for disjoint events (P(U ∪ V) = P(U) + P(V) for disjoint U, V). Likewise, Π(∅) = 0 and Π(Ω) = 1 (where Ω is the universal set of outcomes)​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
, similar to probability measures. The dual of possibility, called the necessity measure N, captures certainty: N(A) = 1 – Π(A<sup>c</sup>)​
ARXIV.ORG
, meaning an event A is necessary to the extent that its complement is impossible. Together, Π and N provide upper and lower bounds on the likelihood of events, in line with possibility theory’s role in imprecise probability modeling.Comparison with Probability Theory: Possibility theory and probability theory both handle uncertainty but with different semantics and combination rules:
Additivity vs. Maxitivity: Probability measures are additive (or σ-additive), meaning the probability of a union of disjoint events is the sum of their probabilities. In contrast, possibility measures are maxitive (also called supremum-preserving) – the possibility of a union of disjoint events is the maximum of their individual possibilities​
ARXIV.ORG
. This max-rule reflects that if either event is highly possible, their union is equally highly possible (whereas probability would dilute the measure across alternatives).
Normalization: A probability distribution spreads a total weight of 1 across all outcomes (so probabilities sum to 1 over the outcome space). A possibility distribution instead requires only that some outcome has π(x)=1​
ARXIV.ORG
 (at least one outcome is completely possible). Multiple outcomes can even have π(x)=1 concurrently, indicating several fully possible states. This allows possibility theory to represent complete ignorance by assigning 1 to all outcomes (everything is possible, nothing is ruled out), something probability cannot do without introducing a uniform distribution (which still imposes a specific fractional belief for each outcome).
Combination (AND) Operations: In probability theory, if we assume independence, the probability of a joint event (A and B) is typically the product P(A)·P(B). In possibility theory, the analogue is to use a t-norm (a triangular norm) to combine the degrees of possibility. A common choice is the minimum operator: π<sub>A∩B</sub>(x) = min(π<sub>A</sub>(x), π<sub>B</sub>(x)), which means the possibility of a state satisfying both A and B is the lesser of their individual possibilities. More generally, t-norms provide a family of “AND” operations in fuzzy logic (e.g. min, product, etc.), and dually t-conorms (like max) serve as “OR” operations. Thus, where probability uses multiplication for conjunction, possibility theory often uses min as a logical conjunction and max as a disjunction to compute combined events’ possibilities.
Interpretation of Values: A probability of 0.5 for an event often implies a specific quantitative uncertainty (e.g. a 50% chance). A possibility of 0.5 simply means the event is neither completely ruled out nor fully plausible – it carries an ordinal sense of plausibility rather than a precise frequency. In decision-making, probability theory relies on expected values (integrals of probability distributions), whereas possibility theory often relies on ranking outcomes by possibility/necessity or using criteria like the maximin or maximax principle, reflecting a more qualitative decision outlook.
In summary, possibility theory can be viewed as operating on a different calculus of uncertainty than probability: one built on the supremum and infimum (max–min) instead of sum and product. This relationship has been formalized through concepts like min/max algebra (dating back to G.L.S. Shackle’s work in the 1950s) which influenced the later development of possibility theory​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. Importantly, possibility theory is fully coherent mathematically (it is a special case of a non-additive measure, or a fuzzy measure), and it provides a complementary way to handle uncertainty that is especially suited to incomplete information or qualitative expert knowledge.
Algebraic Underpinnings of Possibility Theory
Possibility theory is underlain by algebraic structures from fuzzy set theory and lattice theory, which contrast with the classical sigma-algebra of probability. Key concepts include suprema (joins), infima (meets), t-norms, and fuzzy measures, each playing a role analogous to operations in probability but within an ordinal or non-additive framework.
Suprema and Maxitive Measures: As noted, the core of possibility measure is the use of supremum (least upper bound) to evaluate the union of events. A possibility measure Π is supremum-preserving over disjoint events: Π(A ∪ B) = max(Π(A), Π(B))​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. More generally, a measure satisfying Π(∪<sub>i</sub> A<sub>i</sub>) = max<sub>i</sub> Π(A<sub>i</sub>) for any collection of mutually exclusive events is called maxitive​
ARXIV.ORG
. This property is the qualitative counterpart to the additive property of probabilities. The use of suprema (max) gives possibility theory a lattice structure: uncertainties are ordered by an ordinal scale of plausibility. Because of this, possibility theory can operate even with purely ordinal rankings of outcomes, whereas probability requires numeric weights that sum up.
t-norms and Intersection (Conjunction): In fuzzy logic (which possibility theory builds upon), a t-norm is a binary operation that generalizes the logical AND for fuzzy sets. Common t-norms include minimum, product, Lukasciewicz t-norm, etc., with the minimum (Gödel t-norm) being a typical choice for possibility theory. If π<sub>X</sub> and π<sub>Y</sub> are possibility distributions for events X and Y, the possibility of their intersection X∧Y can be defined as $(\pi_X \land \pi_Y)(x) = \text{min}(\pi_X(x),, \pi_Y(x))$ for each state x. This ensures that an outcome must be plausible in both X and Y to be plausible in their conjunction, using the smaller of the two degrees. Dually, the t-conorm (such as maximum) serves for the union (logical OR), which we already see in Π’s max rule. These operations (max for OR, min for AND) form the basis of the max–min algebra that governs possibilistic calculations​
ARXIV.ORG
. In contrast, probability theory’s conjunction corresponds to multiplication (for independent events) and union corresponds to addition minus intersection (Inclusion–Exclusion principle). Thus, possibility’s algebra replaces +/× with ∨/∧ (max/min), yielding a very different arithmetic of uncertainty.
Fuzzy Measures and Integrals: Possibility measures belong to the family of fuzzy measures (also called monotonic measures or capacities). A fuzzy measure generalizes the idea of a measure by dropping additivity; it only requires monotonicity (if A⊆B then measure(A) ≤ measure(B)). Possibility and necessity measures are examples that satisfy additional properties (maxitivity for possibility, minitivity for necessity). In decision theory, instead of integrating probabilities with outcomes (expected value via Lebesgue or Choquet integrals), one can integrate possibilities with outcomes using the Sugeno integral. The Sugeno integral is a nonlinear aggregation operator based on max and min, often described as an ordinal analog of the Choquet integral​
ARXIV.ORG
. In fact, Dubois and Prade provided axiomatic justifications for decision criteria based on possibility theory (max–min rules) in analogy to von Neumann-Morgenstern’s expected utility theory​
ARXIV.ORG
. For example, a decision-maker using possibility theory might apply a maximin strategy: evaluate each action by the minimum degree of satisfaction (necessity) it guarantees, then pick the action with the highest such value. This is akin to a pessimistic criterion (ensuring a certain level of outcome), whereas a maximax strategy would use the maximum possible outcome (an optimistic criterion). These strategies connect to the lattice operations (infimum for maximin, supremum for maximax) and highlight how algebraic structures replace linear expectations in possibilistic decision-making.
In summary, the algebraic underpinnings of possibility theory rely on lattice-theoretic operations (suprema and infima) combined with fuzzy logic operators (t-norms/t-conorms), rather than the additive linear structure of probability. This gives possibility theory a qualitative, non-linear flavor. It is particularly powerful in scenarios where information is incomplete or only ordinal rankings are available. The trade-off is that one loses the precise calculus of probabilities, but gains a framework that can express complete ignorance and handle epistemic uncertainty in a more flexible way. These characteristics make possibility theory an intriguing candidate for modeling uncertainty in complex decision problems – including those faced in reinforcement learning – where knowledge about the environment may be vague or incomplete.
Relevance to Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make sequences of decisions to maximize cumulative reward in an uncertain environment. Uncertainty in RL comes in two main forms: aleatory uncertainty (randomness in outcomes, e.g. stochastic rewards or transitions) and epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty due to the agent’s incomplete knowledge of the environment). Possibility theory offers a fresh perspective on handling especially the latter.Uncertainty Modeling in RL: Traditionally, RL methods handle uncertainty using probability theory – for example, modeling state transition probabilities, or using Bayesian approaches to handle uncertainty in value estimates. However, possibility theory can offer a qualitatively different way to model uncertainty. Instead of requiring a precise probability distribution over outcomes (which may be hard to estimate from limited data), an agent could maintain a possibility distribution over outcomes or value estimates, representing what is plausible given the knowledge so far. This aligns well with epistemic uncertainty: if an agent has not explored a region of the state space, under possibility theory it could assign high possibility to those unknown states having high reward (since it cannot rule that out) without committing to a low probability due to lack of evidence. In essence, possibility theory naturally implements a form of optimism under uncertainty – a crucial principle for exploration. Indeed, epistemic uncertainty is considered the key driver for exploration in RL​
RLJ.CS.UMASS.EDU
, and possibility theory explicitly represents that uncertainty as a range of possible outcomes instead of a single expected outcome. By distinguishing what is possible from what is likely, an RL agent can behave more cautiously optimistic: it can consider that an action might yield a high payoff even if it’s not yet statistically justified, thereby encouraging exploration of actions that have not been disproven to be good.Epistemic Uncertainty and Exploration: One of the challenges in RL is efficient exploration – the agent must try actions that are uncertain to discover potentially better rewards. Probability-based methods (like Bayesian RL or upper confidence bounds) address this by inflating value estimates using statistical uncertainty. Possibility theory provides an alternate mechanism: the agent can use possibility measures to gauge the extent of its ignorance and necessity measures to gauge its certainty. For example, an agent could choose actions based on their potential value (e.g., the maximum possible Q-value under current plausible hypotheses) rather than the expected value. This is analogous to an optimistic exploration strategy – essentially assuming the best until proven otherwise. If an action has even a small probability of being optimal, a classical approach might eventually try it, but a possibilistic approach could consider it “fully possible” until evidence reduces its possibility. Thus, possibility theory inherently leans toward an optimistic evaluation of the unknown, which can be leveraged for directed exploration.Concrete exploration strategies can be derived from this. An RL agent could maintain a set of hypothesis value functions or models and treat them in a possibilistic manner: if any hypothesis suggests a high reward for an action, the possibility of that high reward is high, prompting the agent to give the action a try. This idea connects to ensemble methods (discussed more below) and to methods like Bootstrapped DQN, where multiple value estimates are used to drive exploration by representing uncertainty​
ARXIV.ORG
. The difference is that with possibility theory, the combination rule would focus on the maximal value among the ensemble (reflecting one plausible hypothesis) rather than an average. In essence, possibility theory formalizes a kind of upper envelope of uncertainty, which directly ties to exploration bonuses or optimistic initial values commonly used in RL.Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning: Another area where possibility theory’s concepts enter RL is through fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets. Fuzzy reinforcement learning methods use fuzzy inference systems to approximate value functions or policies. In a fuzzy system, states or state-action pairs can belong to fuzzy sets with certain membership grades – these grades are effectively possibility values (degrees of truth). Zadeh’s introduction of fuzzy sets was itself aimed at handling uncertainty and imprecision​
OAEPUBLISH.COM
, so it is natural that fuzzy RL applies possibility-like reasoning. For instance, fuzzy Q-learning might represent the Q-value not as a single number but via fuzzy rules that output a fuzzy set of possible Q-values. The result is a range of possible value estimates rather than one precise estimate. This can make learning more robust to uncertainty and generalize better in continuous state spaces. In practice, fuzzy RL algorithms often create rule-based representations of the value function or policy and update them with RL techniques. Because these rules capture degrees of membership, the agent can reason with statements like “state X is somewhat similar to state Y which had a high reward, so it’s possible that X also yields high reward.” This interpolation of experience via fuzzy rules is a qualitative way to handle uncertainty and continuous variables.Moreover, fuzzy RL contributes to interpretability. By using possibility theory under the hood (through fuzzy sets), the learned policy can be expressed in linguistically interpretable rules (e.g., “IF speed is high AND battery is low THEN the possibility of failure is high”). This is valuable for explainable AI. Recent work on combining fuzzy logic with deep RL has shown that we can achieve performance comparable to standard deep RL while retaining explainability​
OAEPUBLISH.COM
​
OAEPUBLISH.COM
. For example, Zander (2023) applied Deep Q-Learning principles to an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and achieved performance on par with a traditional DQN in a control task, demonstrating the viability of marrying RL with fuzzy (possibilistic) representations​
OAEPUBLISH.COM
. The study highlighted “the value of exploring the intersection of RL and fuzzy logic in producing explainable systems”​
OAEPUBLISH.COM
. This underscores that beyond just handling uncertainty, possibility theory (via fuzzy logic) can bring practical benefits to RL, such as improved generalization and interpretability, by capturing the epistemic uncertainty in a human-understandable way.In summary, possibility theory is relevant to RL in that it offers a complementary approach to uncertainty. It directly tackles epistemic uncertainty – crucial for exploration – by representing what might be true in the absence of evidence. It also naturally aligns with fuzzy approaches to RL, which have been successfully used to handle continuous states and provide interpretable policies. By leveraging possibility theory, an RL agent can become aware of its own knowledge and ignorance, enabling strategies that are optimistic when knowledge is sparse and appropriately cautious as certainty (necessity) grows​
FNC.CO.UK
. This different mindset on uncertainty can enhance exploration, robustness, and even explainability in reinforcement learning systems.
Applications to Deep Q-Learning and Ensemble Q-Networks
Modern reinforcement learning has seen great success with deep learning techniques – notably, Deep Q-Learning (DQL), where neural networks approximate the Q-value function. Here we discuss how possibility theory can enhance such approaches, and how it plays a role in ensemble methods like ensemble Q-networks.Possibility-Enhanced Deep Q-Learning: Standard Deep Q-Learning (as in DQN) produces point estimates of Q-values for each state-action. However, these estimates can be uncertain, especially early in learning or in unseen states. Incorporating possibility theory means we allow the Q-output to be a possibilistic quantity rather than a single scalar. In practice, this could be implemented in a few ways. One approach is to have the network output confidence bounds or a distribution of Q-values (similar to distributional RL, but using a possibility distribution instead of a probability distribution). For example, instead of predicting Q(s,a) = 5, a network might predict that Q(s,a) is possibly as high as 8 and at least necessarily 2. This could be represented by an upper and lower bound (which relate to possibility and necessity respectively). Training such a network would involve updating not only the central estimate but also these bounds based on new data – effectively learning a possibility interval for Q. The upper bound (possibility) of Q(s,a) represents an optimistic estimate (the maximum plausible value), while the lower bound (necessity) represents a cautious estimate (the value that’s almost certain). Decision-making could then use these: an exploratory policy might favor actions with high possible Q (even if their necessary Q is low) to gather more information, whereas a conservative policy might rely on actions with high necessary Q to ensure reliable outcomes.Recent ideas in distributional reinforcement learning provide inspiration: methods like Quantile Regression DQN model a full distribution of returns by predicting multiple quantiles​
PROCEEDINGS.MLR.PRESS
. They have shown improved performance because the agent captures risk and uncertainty in the value estimates. Possibility theory offers an alternative way to capture a distribution – not by probability percentiles, but by plausible ranges. A possibility-based DQN might maintain a small set of values for each Q (e.g., minimum, most plausible, and maximum) or even a shaped membership function over possible Q values. This could similarly improve learning by providing richer feedback than a single-point estimate. It also inherently provides an exploration mechanism: if an action’s maximum possible Q is high, the agent will be inclined to try it, even if the expected value (or median) is lower. This is akin to having an optimistic bias in learning but grounded in a formal possibilistic framework.Moreover, training a deep network to output a possibility distribution could be achieved by proper loss functions. For instance, one could use a loss that penalizes inconsistency with observed returns in a possibilistic sense – e.g. if a certain reward is observed, it must fall within the predicted possible range for the corresponding state-action. The Sugeno integral might replace the expectation in Bellman updates for a possibilistic Bellman equation, where the backup operation uses max-min algebra instead of expectation. While these ideas are still exploratory, they hint that Deep Possibilistic Q-Learning can be formulated to enhance how uncertainty is handled in deep RL.Ensemble Q-Networks and Possibility Weighting: Ensemble methods in RL maintain multiple estimates for the value function or policy. This is often used to quantify uncertainty: if the ensemble predictions diverge, the agent is less certain. A prime example is the Bootstrapped DQN, which uses an ensemble of Q-networks (with different random initializations or training data subsets) to produce a set of Q-value estimates​
ARXIV.ORG
. The agent can use these multiple estimates to guide exploration – for instance, by randomly selecting one head’s policy per episode (posterior sampling) or by computing an optimism bonus based on the variance among the heads. Possibility theory can naturally complement such ensemble approaches by providing a framework to aggregate the ensemble predictions in a non-probabilistic way.In a possibilistic ensemble, each network in the ensemble could be considered as representing one possible model of the Q function. Instead of averaging them or using variance, we could derive an overall possibility distribution for Q from their outputs. For instance, suppose we have three neural networks predicting Q(s,a) = 4, 7, and 5 for some state-action. A probabilistic approach might take an average (~5.33) or fit a distribution (mean 5.33, some variance). A possibilistic approach would say: given these independent hypotheses, the possibility of Q(s,a) being as high as 7 is high (because one network predicts 7 confidently), and the necessity of Q(s,a) being at least 4 is high (since all networks predict ≥4). We might construct a fuzzy interval [4, 7] as the range of plausible values. The agent could then use the upper end of this range (7) when exploring (since Q could possibly be 7) and the lower end (4) when planning conservatively. This is effectively a possibility-weighted Q evaluation: the ensemble gives a fuzzy estimate of Q. In decision-making, one might choose the action with the highest possible Q (max of upper bounds) to explore, but ensure that ultimately the choices have adequately high necessary Q as well, to avoid chasing wild possibilities that never materialize.Possibility weighting can also refer to combining ensemble outputs with fuzzy weights. For example, if each ensemble member has an associated confidence (or validity) value, one could use a weighted fuzzy aggregation (like a weighted max or a fuzzy rule) to combine them. This would result in an aggregated possibility distribution that accounts for both the spread of predictions and their reliabilities. Such possibilistic ensembles could improve decision-making by being more robust to outliers than averaging (since an extremely high prediction doesn’t get diluted by averaging – it directly sets a high possible value) and more cautious than relying on a single estimator (since the lowest predictions set a floor via necessity).Early empirical evidence for the efficacy of possibilistic approaches in RL comes from domains like cybersecurity. A recent proof-of-concept called Possibilistic Q-Learning (PQL) applied possibility-based uncertainty modeling to an RL agent for network defense​
FNC.CO.UK
. The PQL agent maintained awareness of what it knew versus did not know about the environment by quantifying uncertainty possibilistically. This approach led to improved decision-making under high-risk conditions: the agent could efficiently recommend defensive actions by considering the worst-case and best-case outcomes encoded in possibility distributions​
FNC.CO.UK
. In fact, PQL outperformed state-of-the-art probabilistic strategies in scenarios with limited data, presumably because it made better use of sparse information by not underestimating what could be possible​
FNC.CO.UK
. Likewise, in games or robotics, a possibilistic DQN or ensemble might similarly outperform standard methods when dealing with novel or rare events, as it won’t prematurely assume low probability events are negligible if they are still possible.In summary, integrating possibility theory with deep Q-learning and ensemble methods can enhance RL in several ways. It introduces a built-in mechanism for optimism (via possible returns) and caution (via necessary returns), helping tackle the exploration-exploitation trade-off more effectively. It provides a way to combine multiple estimators without averaging out crucial information, by focusing on the range of possibilities. And it aligns with an agent maintaining an explicit model of its uncertainty, leading to more informed and potentially safer decision-making. These benefits make a compelling case for further developing possibility-weighted Q-networks and related algorithms as part of the deep RL toolbox.
Additional Research Directions
The intersection of possibility theory and reinforcement learning is still an emerging area. There are several promising research directions and extensions that go beyond the current state-of-the-art, many of which offer opportunities for novel contributions:
Beyond Quantile Models: Current distributional RL methods (such as C51 or quantile regression DQN) capture uncertainty in terms of probability distributions over returns​
PROCEEDINGS.MLR.PRESS
. A natural extension is to develop possibilistic distributional RL models. Instead of predicting a set of quantiles or probabilities, an agent could predict a possibility distribution over returns or Q-values. This could involve new network architectures or loss functions that learn to maximize consistency with observed rewards in a possibilistic sense. An interesting aspect would be blending these approaches: for example, converting a learned return distribution into a possibility/necessity pair that highlights worst-case and best-case scenarios for risk-sensitive planning. Pushing beyond quantiles, we might consider interval Q-learning or fuzzy Q-values that propagate through the Bellman updates. Theoretical work on possibilistic POMDPs​
ARXIV.ORG
​
ARXIV.ORG
 and MDPs provides a starting point for how dynamic programming can be done in qualitative frameworks; translating those ideas to function approximation and deep learning is a ripe area for exploration.
Possibility-Based Exploration Strategies: While the optimistic bias of possibility theory aids exploration, there is room to design explicit exploration bonuses or strategies derived from possibilistic uncertainty. For instance, one could define an exploration reward for an action proportional to the difference between its possibility and necessity values (i.e., how large the uncertainty gap is). This would reward the agent for exploring actions that have a high possible upside but low guaranteed value, focusing exploration where epistemic uncertainty is greatest. Another approach could be to maintain multiple possible models of the environment (as in Thompson sampling for RL) but use a possibilistic criterion to decide when an observation significantly reduces the possibility of some model, thereby focusing on experiments that rule out possibilities quickly. These strategies could be tested against traditional methods like ε-greedy or UCB, potentially offering more efficient exploration in environments where probabilities are hard to estimate.
Hybrid Uncertainty Models: One intriguing direction is combining probability and possibility in a single framework. For example, an agent might use probability theory for parts of the problem that are well-understood (aleatory uncertainty with lots of data) and possibility theory for parts that are poorly understood (epistemic uncertainty with sparse data). This hybrid approach could draw on imprecise probability theory, where possibility distributions often serve as upper envelopes of credal sets (sets of probability distributions)​
CITESEERX.IST.PSU.EDU
. In RL, this might manifest as the agent maintaining a set of plausible probabilistic models of the environment and summarizing them as a single possibility distribution for decision-making. Research into credal RL (RL with sets of probabilities) intersects here and could benefit from the computational simplicity of using possibility measures as proxies for these sets.
Risk-Sensitive and Safety-Critical RL: Possibility theory’s dual measures (possibility and necessity) naturally lend themselves to optimistic and pessimistic assessments of outcomes. This can be leveraged in risk-sensitive RL. For example, in safe exploration or autonomous driving, an agent might need to ensure that certain catastrophes remain highly improbable. By modeling those rare events with possibility theory, one could focus on ensuring the necessity of safety (i.e., high confidence that bad outcomes won’t occur). Methods like shielding or safe RL constraints could incorporate necessity measures as formal guards (e.g., requiring N(accident) below a threshold). Conversely, in seeking high-reward strategies, an agent might pursue actions that have a small probability but a non-zero possibility of very high payoff, balancing risk and reward in a new way. Research into the Sugeno integral for reward criteria might produce alternative objectives for RL that maximize a possibilistic notion of utility (ensuring a good worst-case as much as a good average-case).
Deep Learning Architectures for Possibility: To fully integrate possibility theory in deep RL, new architectures or training techniques may be needed. This could include neural networks that output fuzzy membership functions (e.g., using specialized output layers or loss functions that enforce max-normalization of outputs). Another idea is ensemble-distillation into a single possibilistic network: train a network to predict the range of outputs that an ensemble of probabilistic networks would give. This marries ensemble uncertainty with a compact possibilistic representation. Additionally, attention mechanisms could be used for rule extraction in fuzzy systems, allowing a deep network to learn interpretable rules on the fly that summarize what it has learned (contributing to explainability).
Underexplored Theoretical Links: There is also theoretical work to be done in drawing parallels between possibility-based RL and established frameworks. For instance, how does a possibilistic value iteration converge, and under what conditions? Some early work has shown that in qualitative MDP models, the belief state space can remain finite (in contrast to continuous probabilities)​
ARXIV.ORG
, which could mean computational benefits. Another link is to belief functions (Dempster-Shafer theory) which generalize probability and possibility – perhaps an RL framework that uses belief functions could provide even more nuanced uncertainty handling. Exploring these connections could yield algorithms that adapt techniques like Bayesian inference or temporal-difference learning into the possibilistic domain with performance guarantees.
In conclusion, possibility theory opens up a range of new directions for reinforcement learning research. It challenges us to rethink how we model uncertainty, moving away from solely quantitative frequency-based views to qualitative plausibility-based views. This shift can lead to novel algorithms for exploration, new ways to ensure safety and robustness, and synergies with fuzzy logic for interpretability. As an underexplored intersection, possibility-based RL holds promise for advancing both theoretical understanding and practical capabilities of agents operating under uncertainty. For an undergraduate thesis, delving into these topics offers the chance to contribute to a relatively fresh area, potentially laying groundwork that future researchers can build upon in the quest for more intelligent and reliable learning agents.
