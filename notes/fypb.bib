              discussed. The problem of combining possibility distributions
              viewed as upper probabilities is investigated, and the basic fuzzy

  abstract = {The theory of possibility described in this paper is related to
              the theory of fuzzy sets by defining the concept of a possibility
              distribution as a fuzzy restriction which acts as an elastic
              constraint on the values that may be assigned to a variable. More
              specifically, if F is a fuzzy subset of a universe of discourse U={
              u} which is characterized by its membership function μF, then a
              proposition of the form “X is F,” where X is a variable taking
              values in U, induces a possibility distribution ∏X which equates
              the possibility of X taking the value u to μF(u)—the compatibility
              of u with F. In this way, X becomes a fuzzy variable which is
              associated with the possibility distribution ∏x in much the same
              way as a random variable is associated with a probability
              distribution. In general, a variable may be associated both with a
              possibility distribution and a probability distribution, with the
              weak connection between the two expressed as the
              possibility/probability consistency principle. A thesis advanced in
              this paper is that the imprecision that is intrinsic in natural
              languages is, in the main, possibilistic rather than probabilistic
              in nature. Thus, by employing the concept of a possibility
              distribution, a proposition, p, in a natural language may be
              translated into a procedure which computes the probability
              distribution of a set of attributes which are implied by p. Several
              types of conditional translation rules are discussed and, in
              particular, a translation rule for propositions of the form “X is F
              is α-possible,” where α is a number in the interval [0, 1], is
              formulated and illustrated by examples.},
