# Possibilistic Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the code and experiments for my honours thesis on applying possibility theory to deep reinforcement learning. We propose three algorithms that model and leverage epistemic uncertainty for more efficient exploration. More details can be found in `reports/fyp.pdf`.

## Experiments

You can re-run the experiments using the following scripts:

- `run_exp_1.py` — **Mean–Variance Possibilistic DQN**
- `run_exp_2.py` — **Possibilistic Q-Ensembles**
- `run_exp_3.py` — **Possibilistic Model-Based Learning** (both one-step and two-step roll-outs)
